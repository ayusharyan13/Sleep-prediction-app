Kafka for async sening notification:
Asynchronous Processing: By using Kafka, Tasks such as like sending emails, updating status, or any other non-critical, time-consuming operations to a Kafka topic. The main API will then respond quickly, and a separate consumer will handle the actual task asynchronously.

Decoupling Services: Kafka will help decouple the components of your application, improving scalability and reliability. For example, the main API can publish messages to Kafka without waiting for the notification service to complete.

Batch Processing: Kafka can handle batch processing more efficiently. Can accumulate multiple notification requests and process them in batches, which is much more efficient than handling one at a time.
