Your decision tree suggests that having a quiet environment may contribute to a better sleep quality. Try using earplugs or a white noise machine to block out noise.\n> * **Incorporate more running into your daily routine**. Your decision tree indicates that running may enhance sleep quality. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity running most days of the week.\n> * **Consider reducing your screen time before bed**. Your decision tree suggests that using electronic devices close to bedtime may interfere with sleep quality. Try to avoid using screens for at least an hour before you go to bed.\n> * **Maintain a consistent sleep-wake cycle**. Go to bed and wake up around the same time every day, even on weekends.
